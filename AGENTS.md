Instructions for Agent

## Agent conduct

* Verify assumptions before executing commands; call out uncertainties first.
* Ask for clarification when the request is ambiguous, destructive, or risky.
* Summarize intent before performing multi-step fixes so the user can redirect early.
* Cite the source when using documentation; quote exact lines instead of paraphrasing from memory.
* Dont't create documentation files beside README.md and CONTINUITY.md - NEVER!
* Don't create unit test or other test system files
* Do not repeat yourself or give redundant explanations - keep it to the point.

## Language rules and system details

* We are working on a Windows machine
* use ripgrep for local searches
* Adhere to PEP 8 coding standards
* Even if promprs are in a different natural language, only use english in code
* NEVER use emojies or symbols in project files


## Editing files

- Make the smallest safe change that solves the issue.
- Preserve existing style and conventions.
- Prefer patch-style edits (small, reviewable diffs) over full-file rewrites.
- After making changes, run lint/build checks

## Reading project documents (PDFs, uploads, long text, CSVs, etc)

- Read the full document first.
- Draft the output.
- **Before finalizing**, re-read the original source to verify:
  - factual accuracy,
  - no invented details,
  - wording/style is preserved unless the user explicitly asked to rewrite.
- If paraphrasing is required, label it explicitly as a paraphrase.

## State & living docs

Maintain:

`README.md` — stable overview of functionality and architecture

'CONTINUITY.md' — REQUIRED, see below

Maintain a single continuity file for the current workspace: `.agent/CONTINUITY.md`.

- `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` is a living document and canonical briefing designed to survive compaction; do not rely on earlier chat/tool output unless it's reflected there.

- At the start of each assistant turn: read `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` before acting.

### File Format

Update `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` only when there is a meaningful delta in:

  - `[PLANS]`: "Plans Log" is a guide for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.
  - `[DECISIONS]`: "Decisions Log" is used to record all decisions made.
  - `[PROGRESS]`: "Progress Log" is used to record course changes mid-implementation, documenting why and reflecting upon the implications.
  - `[DISCOVERIES]`: "Discoveries Log" is for when when you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal.
  - `[OUTCOMES]`: "Outcomes Log" is used at completion of a major task or the full plan, summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.
  
### Anti-drift / anti-bloat rules

- Facts only, no transcripts, no raw logs.
- Every entry must include:
  - a date in ISO timestamp (e.g., `2026-01-13T09:42Z`)
  - a provenance tag: `[USER]`, `[CODE]`, `[TOOL]`, `[ASSUMPTION]`
  - If unknown, write `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess). If something changes, supersede it explicitly (don't silently rewrite history).
- Keep the file bounded, short and high-signal (anti-bloat). 
- If sections begin to become bloated, compress older items into milestone (`[MILESTONE]`) bullets.

## Definition of done

A task is done when:

- the requested change is implemented or the question is answered,
  - verification is provided:
  - build attempted (only when buildable source code changed!),
  - linting run (when source code changed),
  - errors/warnings addressed (or explicitly listed and agreed as out-of-scope),
- README.md is updated,
- impact is explained (what changed, where, why),
- follow-ups are listed if anything was intentionally left out.
- `.agent/CONTINUITY.md` is updated if the change materially affects goal/state/decisions.
